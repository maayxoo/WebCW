References:
We used our own ideas and initiatives to develop this app as shown below. We took inpiration from our previous coursework and had a look at various examples such as the social app. 

Martin Truongson Vu- Created the custom user model and the unit tests for sign up and login.
Maya Magdic- Along with Zaina, was responsible for the user profile editing using AJAX, Vue and Fetch api.
Salama Attia- Created the 'friend requests' function which allows two users to become friendS and partially displayed the hobbies (model).
